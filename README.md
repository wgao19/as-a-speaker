## A bit of history (log)...

v0.1

Mar 21, 2019

This is roughly half a year from where the older repo was born.
I'm regularly speaking at React Knowledgeable now, organizing speaking workshops to help our developers speak.
I'm also getting more involved with the local community so I'm starting a new repo to build a speaking site.

v0.0

This repo originated from my sharing on the [React Rally](http://reactrally.com) conference I went to. 
We could not find a meeting room that day, so we sneaked in a secret space in our company that turned out to work really well for sharings. 
So I took up the chance to expand our weekly sharing to a more organized form.

I'm still exploring this topic. 
But I am personally giving more talks as I prepare for our weekly sharing.
So I am refactoring this repo to my general talks repo.
