## A bit of history (log)...

v0.1

Mar 21, 2019

This is roughly half a year from where the older repo was born.
I'm regularly speaking at React Knowledgeable now, organizing speaking workshops to help our developers speak.
I'm also getting more involved with the local community so I'm starting a new repo to build a speaking site.

v0.0

This repo originated from my sharing on a React Rally conference I went to. 
We could not find a meeting room that day, so we sneaked in a cozy space in our company that turned out to work really well for sharings. 
Then I somehow got the space for good and started organizing our weekly sharing series as React Knowledgeable.

I'm still exploring myself as a public speaker. 
But I am personally giving more talks as I prepare for our weekly sharing.
I thought it's a good idea to put them together in this repo.
