              I am a React developer, and I am kind of a fan of Dan Abramov's.
              December of last year, he created a new blog site called
              overreacted.io üò≤ He uses this lovely pinkish theme and has those
              cute coffee indicators for how long it might take to read.

              One idea from Gatsby that facilitates this is that it allows you
              to pick a starter and get to your content quickly. I think it
              actually encourages you to start with a starter. Here is the
              starter library that contains official and community starters.

              For example, I was particularly interested in this community site
              starter when I was creating the site for our React Knowledgeable.
              It has implemented a few utility fields in the frontmatter of each
              post (markdown files) and it organizes the pages according to
              community events. It also checks and computes days to display
              information such as the event is upcoming or has already passed.

                I‚Äôd like to mention again that for all those feature, you‚Äôre
                gonna write React and GraphQL. This goes beyond the scope of
                customizability of a themed blog because once you‚Äôre done
                running the starter script, the code is completely handed over
                to you.

              <p>
                This is perhaps one reason why us React engineers might both
                gain the most satisfaction and be most expressive with building
                a static sites with Gatsby.

              There is one that I think can be particularly interesting to us.
              The gatsby-advanced-starter which is nearly barebone in terms of
              features, it specifically does not join the fight for styling, and
              it leaves nearly all customizability to us. But it does nicely
              come with some essentials such as SEO, Google Analytics, tags and
              categories, twitter, etc.

              functions is, in actuality, to help readers <i>avoid</i> reading.

                There are similarities and differences between book printing and
                web typography. But their motivations are rather aligned, and
                beside the apparent styling purpose we may think of, I‚Äôd like to
                quote this:
              </p>
              <p>
                So typography is this set of rules of font families, font sizes,
                indents, line spacings, progression of headers, etc etc, that
                defines how your website displays its content, mainly texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, this serves as our mini intro to typography which I‚Äôd like
                to have a separate talk if folks are interested, today I‚Äôll show
                you how it works in the blog starter.

              Kyle also developed a library called Typography that allows you to
              choose from a repertoire of themes that you may use directly. You
              may see those themes in this demo website.

  const typography = new Typography({

  baseLineHeight: 1.666,
  headerFontFamily: ['Avenir Next', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'],
  bodyFontFamily: ['Georgia', 'serif'],
  // See below for the full list of options.
})
              
// Output CSS as string.
typography.toString()
              
// Or insert styles directly into the head (works well for client-only

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                You may as well define your own typography. How it works is that
                you define some basics to your site‚Äôs typography. It will help
                you sort out (or lets you customize) the font sizing, line
                spacing, etc, using a mechanism called vertical rhythm.
              </p>
              <p>
                This once again aligns with how Gatsby provides us with both the
                readiness and customizability of how we want to implement our
                sites.

                So this guy is a chef from a Michelin starred restaurant. And
                apparently he doesn't cook.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is like you work for Facebook and you never want to look at
                React once you reach home.

                This is from a local food critique. If I'm not wrong, he used to
                own or chef a cafe as well. Regardless, he posts reviews and his
                own or his wife's cooking on a daily basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                I personally follow him on Instagram, and I've learned many of
                the local places to eat from there.
              </p>
              <p>
                So this is like you have a living around React, while also keep
                telling people what you think is good about it.

                Also creating a bunch of hashtags.

                This is the wife of a chef and co-owner of a Michelin 2-star
                restaurant. She, the wife, has 185k followers on Instagram where
                she posts her cooking, just so we are clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                So this is like you are a star engineer, got no time to do React
                at home at all, but your wife does it, writes book about it, and
                teaches your kid to do it.

                Food becomes crap in no time. So food is literally nonsense. But
                can we live without food?
              </p>
              <p>
                So what‚Äôs this Gatsby nonsense here? We have professional tools
                called React that we use in our day time jobs. And then there is
                this Gatsby that says hey, here‚Äôs how you can create some
                nonsense real quick if you want, since you know React already
                then why not?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you don‚Äôt have a blog where you can post nonsense just yet,
                you should create one this weekend :D
