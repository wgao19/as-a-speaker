              I am a React developer, and I am kind of a fan of Dan Abramov's.
              December of last year, he created a new blog site called
              overreacted.io üò≤ He uses this lovely pinkish theme and has those
              cute coffee indicators for how long it might take to read.

              And as a senior developer, he also suggests that we keep a blog to
              catalog our thoughts. I believe that even many of us here would
              agree, but hasn‚Äôt really kept one. Aside from the fact that
              keeping a blog takes persistence, have you ever thought that the
              idea of a web blog has been more seriously verbose than geeky and
              fun?

              It allows you to pick a starter and get to your content quickly. I

              While the behavior of picking a starter feels much like picking a
              Wordpress theme, Gatsby starters offers a flexible range of
              customizability.

              True that some of the starters are UI-heavy. And I have found this
              LekoArts who has created multiple themed gatsby starters that are
              popular on the starters list.

              For example, I was particularly interested in this community site
              starter when I was creating the site for our React Knowledgeable.
              It has implemented a few utility fields in the frontmatter of each
              post (markdown files) and it organizes the pages according to
              community events. It also checks and computes days to display
              information such as the event is upcoming or has already passed.

                I‚Äôd like to mention again that for all those feature, you‚Äôre
                gonna write React and GraphQL. This goes beyond the scope of
                customizability of a themed blog because once you‚Äôre done
                running the starter script, the code is completely handed over
                to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is perhaps one reason why us React engineers might both
                gain the most satisfaction and be most expressive with building
                a static sites with Gatsby.

              There is one that I think can be particularly interesting to us.
              The gatsby-advanced-starter which is nearly barebone in terms of
              feature, specifically does not join the fight for styling, and it
              leaves nearly all customizability to us. But it does nicely come
              with some essentials such as SEO, Google Analytics, tags and
              categories, twitter, etc.
