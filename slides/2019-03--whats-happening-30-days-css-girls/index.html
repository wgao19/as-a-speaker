              Earlier this year, Ann from CodingGirls has reached out to me to
              work together on a 30-day online coding challenge. I was wondering
              what a thirty day coding challenge was, so I did a search on
              twitter.

                  Today, I have successfully completed my first week of
                  challenge. Here are my 4 best shots of this week. Thanks to
                  Gigantic. Here is the link to the code.

                As a matter of fact, not only 30 days of challenge, someone put
                #30daysofcode, #100daysofcode, _and_ #301DaysOfCode on one
                single tweet.

                This guys is on a mission towards a 301 days coding challenge
                covering basically everything we use and not use. We should

                girls love good looking things
              </p>
              <p>
                Actually, everybody does. But girls are more external about this
                kind of points I believe. We're quite comfortable saying or
                admitting that we do things for appearance reasons.

              Then, both of us were more of a fan for going deeper into a
              smaller set of knowledge, rather than a shallow overview of a lot
              of things. We want our girls to really get hold of a skill at the
              end of the thirty days.

              We did not give very detailed step-by-step requirement for what we
              wanted our girls to create. With the space for creativity, you
              never know.

            And can anybody claim that there is nothing to learn even when you
            are working on something quite "easy"? Later on we were lucky to
            have Huijing to join us as a mentor, who shared with us what she
            learned working on the heart in a blog post.

              Then, we kind of just started the process of writing blog posts
              about things we learned about css. And started merging each
              others' posts to our static site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of this, I'd like to mention that some of our girls have
              very little programming background, and joined the challenge just
              because they want to check out something cool. One girl, who does
              food critique part time, is picking up markdown and OS
              contribution on the side.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think a lot of girl, self-taught, front end developers are quite
              amazing, if you consider what kind of training she has. By
              figuring a lot of things out by herself, there's a long way to go
              even before a first full time job. There are many, many such
              stories out there, in here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe next time you can hear some stories from such developers
              around you, and maybe next next time when you see her trying to
              make a contribution on her merge request, maybe you can spend more
              time to discuss and guide her to the right direction.

                site here. So you may pick up come of the challenges any time in

                There are many things that need fix also. My good will was to
                leave to participants to fix. But I was not doing a great job
                advocating that. So most of them are still unfixed.

              And what's more, I saw one alternative implementation Huijing
              proposed that seemed really interesting. Since the original bug
              was actually not a CSS bug, rather, it was a JS bug. And we're
              doing CSS here. So I was thinking how I could redirect the thread
