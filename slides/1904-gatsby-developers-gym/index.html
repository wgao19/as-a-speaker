              I am a React developer, and I am kind of a fan of Dan Abramov's.
              December of last year, he created a new blog site called
              overreacted.io üò≤ He uses this lovely pinkish theme and has those
              cute coffee indicators for how long it might take to read.

              And as an expert developer, he also suggests that we keep a blog
              to catalog our thoughts. I believe that even many of us here would
              agree, but hasn‚Äôt really kept one. Aside from the fact that
              keeping a blog takes persistence, have you ever thought that the
              idea of a web blog has been more seriously verbose than geeky and

                For today‚Äôs workshop called Developers‚Äô Gym, I‚Äôm taking the
                liberty of creating a static site for my favorite sport, rock
                climbing. And I‚Äôm gonna call it, ugh, anyhowly.rocks (domain is

              <p>
                And we‚Äôll use Gatsby Advanced Starter (source, demo) today.

              <p>
                The feature about Gatsby Advanced Starter is that it (refer to

                <li>
                  does not join the battle of UI frameworks, so you get to pick
                  your side
                </li>
                <li>
                  but it does nicely include a few essential blogging features
                  including (but does not limit to): tags - categories - google
                  analytics (so you learn about your audience) - disqus (for
                  comments) - SEO

                The command gatsby new comes from the package Gatsby CLI. It is
                intended to be installed globally. When you run gatsby new, what
                it does is that it clones your starter, installs dependencies,
                copies starter files, then remove the .git directory so you can
                initialize your own.

                that ‚Äî the computer fonts we use is in many parts an extension
                of book printing. And a lot of the fonts are a recreate of book
                printing fonts.

                There are similarities and differences between book printing and
                web typography. But their motivations are rather aligned, and
                beside the apparent styling purpose we may think of, I‚Äôd like to
                quote this:
              </p>
              <p>
                So typography is this set of rules of font families, font sizes,
                indents, line spacings, progression of headers, etc etc, that
                defines how your website displays its content, mainly texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, this serves as our mini intro to typography which I‚Äôd like
                to have a separate talk if folks are interested, today I‚Äôll show
                you how it works in the blog starter.

              <p>
                Gatsby‚Äôs creator Kyle has created a TypographyJS library (and a
                large number of util libraries around that). What TypographyJS
                does is it provides a toolkit for us to define the typography
                design of our site.
              </p>

              <p>
                TypographyJS is a monorepo package and it publishes alongside of
                it a repertoire of themes that you may use directly. You may see
                those themes on their demo website.
              </p>

              <p>
                You may as well define your own typography. How it works is that
                you define some basics to your site‚Äôs typography. It will help
                you sort out (or lets you customize) the font sizing, line
                spacing, etc, using a mechanism called vertical rhythm.
              </p>

              <p>
                For today‚Äôs workshop, we are going to create our own
                Typographyjs theme.

              <p>
                TypographyJS allows us to pass in a field for Google Fonts. It
                will automatically load that font for us so that we can use them
                in our theme.

                You should specify a function of three parameters for
                TypographyJS to call. Your function should return your desired
                stylesheet in an object, where the field names are the
                selectors, and the field values are the CSS value object (kebab
                converted to camelCase according to React convention).
              </p>
              <p>
                This allows us to specify highly customized CSS styles. Since
                the field names are simply CSS selectors, it supports:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>media queries</li>
                <li>pseudo element selectors</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Furthermore, it provides us with a few util functions that we
                may use to declaratively write our typography styles. Let‚Äôs talk
                about Vertical Rhythm.

                Food becomes crap in no time. So food is literally nonsense. But
                can we live without food?
              </p>
              <p>
                So what‚Äôs this Gatsby nonsense here? We have professional tools
                called React that we use in our day time jobs. And then there is
                this Gatsby that says hey, here‚Äôs how you can create some
                nonsense real quick if you want, since you know React already
                then why not?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you don‚Äôt have a blog where you can post nonsense just yet,
                you should create one this weekend :D
