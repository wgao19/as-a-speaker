            A very good evening everyone. Welcome to CodingGirls'
            #30DaysOfCSSGirls online challenge's the commencement party. Some of
            us here may have participated in this challenge series for the past
            month (or so), some others have not. Either way, a personal thank
            you to you all. You can be anywhere tonight but you chose to be here
            for a reason.

              I hope most of us are here because you want to learn about how to
              commit yourself to becoming a better front end developer. With the
              context of this #30DaysOfCSSGirls challenges, there are a few
              keywords I'd like to share with you tonight, and hope that you get
              inspired.

              Earlier this year Ann invited me onboard to prepare for a 30 days
              of coding challenge on the topic of web development. We browsed
              through many options. Do we want to do a web development crash
              course? Do we want to include JavaScript? And I got a day job
              writing React components, maybe we can try React?

              We are a group of girl developers, or girls who wish to pick up a

              depth of learning over touching a little bit of everything. While
              thirty days is still way too short for becoming an expert in
              almost anything, we want our girls to learn one skill that they
              can get comfortable building things with.

              <p>
                Then, we kind of just started the process of writing blog posts
                about things we learned about css. And started merging each
                others' posts to our blog site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of this, I'd like to mention that some of our girls
                have very little programming background, and have joined the
                challenge just because they want to check out something cool.
                One of our consistent contributors did not know markdown nor git
                to begin with. But she has made her first contribution to open
                source projects, and has put in consistent effort throughout the
                thirty days.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think a lot of girl, self-taught, front end developers are
                quite amazing, if you consider the lack of systematic training
                we have. There's a long way to go before even finding a full
                time job. And our peers are college graduates who consider
                creating web pages like a non-programming job.
              </p>
              <p>
                And even after some of us have made advancement, it is still
                quite hard to completely get rid of the sense of being an
                intruder and feel we're never gonna be the main stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                So really part of the intention of designing these challenges,
                are really along the line of providing a chance for girls to
                declare something they're proudly good at.

                leave to participants to fix. But I was not doing a great job

              trying to drag the conversation back to CSS. That was a nice night

              CSS is apparently contagious that another coworker, not from the
              original challenges roster, started to work on CSS, and created
              this.

              At this time you can no longer walk past speaking with me about
              CSS without hearing me advocating the CSS specifications. Please
              allow me to share a little bit of my personal story here.

              Not long after I just started working as a front end developer, I
              worked on a design that contains a stamped edge. I didn’t know how
              to do it. So I did what I’ve been doing since college — I googled
              it.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <pre><code>
                .stamp:after {
                  content: '';
                  position: absolute;
                  left: 5px; top: 5px; right: 5px; bottom: 5px;
                  z-index: -1;
                }
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                I came across a number of solutions similar to [this one]. I
                thought I’d try to learn something out of it. After all, I’m a
                professional web developer now. I should not be the one just
                heartlessly copying and pasting snippets, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                So as I tried to understand the code, I thought the line
                content: '' (content semicolon empty string) was irrelevant.
                Maybe the author forgot to take it off. So I left out that line
                and, expectedly, my stamp edge did not show.
              </p>

          <section>
            <pre><code>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                I then went through a whole process of trying to find where that
                pseudo element went. I gave it a super big `width` and `height`,
                `background: red`, etc. I checked parent’s `position` because I
                recalled some relevancy there? But I simply could not find my
                pseudo element. I got so frustrated also because part of me did
                not put CSS as a top priority. My inner voice was like “Please,
                just let me get over with it so I can work on “more interesting”
                stuff”.
              </p>
              <p>
                My problem with this approach was that I did not understand
                where each line of code came from. And what can gravitate this
                issue with CSS is that more often than not *I thought I knew*.

              When their computed content value is not none, these
              pseudo-elements generate boxes as if they were immediate children
              of their originating element, and can be styled exactly like any
              normal document-sourced element in the document tree.

            <aside class="notes">
              A few years later I finally decided to read the CSS
              specifications, and it clearly stated that the pseudo-elements are
              generated when content value is not none.

                Well anyway, looking back, I gained a lot of my imperative
                knowledge that way. Running into the problems, stack overflow,
                until I get very bored of following others' solutions. A lot of
                senior developers have even told me that our field has too many
                scattered pieces of knowledge that I have to master in order to
                do my job properly. Maybe, just maybe, it is not because the
                knowledge is scattered around by themselves. But how we find
                solutions to our problem broke them into scattered pieces?
              </p>
              <p>
                But CSS specifications is one set of well-edited, systematic
                documentations on how browsers should render the page according
                to the stylesheets. You can hardly find any other literature
                that actually helps you build consistent and complete knowledge
                about this aspect of browser behaviors. The more you read the
                CSS specs, the more connection you'll be able to make with one
                another.
              </p>
              <p>
                And furthermore, have you noticed that while some of us struggle
                to pass a so-called "plateau" and stop advancing from certain
                point of time, while some others seem to have kept advancing in
                their proficiency, and have you wondered why?
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I’d like to bring to your all's attention that we do not
                gain proficiency by following others’ solutions. We gain
                proficiency by solving the problems by ourselves. And best
                guidance is one that specifies the features of your tools and
                lets you come up with the solutions by yourself. And CSS
                specifications are exactly this kind of guidance.

              With this challenge series we put a lot of emphasis on the CSS
              specs. On alternate days we did not schedule any coding challenges
              at all, instead, we scheduled "reading time" of CSS
              specifications.

                But in general, a personal lesson learned is this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each set of the CSS specifications may require some dedication
                for you to even begin to read it. But trust me, if have
                long-term goal as a front end developer, this is the most
                time-saving effort for you to master CSS. You'll gain
                cross-browser understanding about how CSS should be implemented
                from the vendors' and editors' perspective. And to share with
                you a secret, it brings this weird feeling of mastering CSS once
                you've read a few critical sections. And people will register
                you as someone who reads CSS specs, must be an expert.
              </p>
              <p>
                And as a girl developer, sense of respect comes in rarer form
                than our guy peers. If we are to master something, do it like we
                mean it.
