          <aside class="notes">
            A very good evening everyone. Welcome to the commencement party of
            CodingGirls' #30DaysOfCSSGirls online challenge. Some of us here may
            have participated in this challenge series for the past month (or
            so), some others have not. Either way, as the designer of these
            challenges as well as a CSS enthusiastic myself, I'd like to convey
            a personal welcome to you tonight. You can be anywhere tonight but
            you chose to be here for a reason.

              Earlier this year when Ann invited me onboard to prepare a 30 days
              of coding challenge on web development, we browsed through many
              options. Do we want to do a web development crash course? Do we
              want to include JavaScript? And I got a day job writing React so
              you cannot escape hearing me think out loud about it.

              Then we thought about this question: Who are we? What do we like?
              We are a group of girl developers, or girls who wish to pick up a
              career as developers. We are mainly self-taught.

              Secondly, both me and Ann are at the stage where we appreciate
              depth of learning more than touching a little bit of everything.
              While thirty days is still way too brief for becoming an expert in
              almost anything, we want our girls to learn one skill until they
              get comfortable building things with.

              Midway through our challenges, she shared with us what she has
              learned by working on the heart challenges with an in-depth post
              on her blog. She shows us in action how you can be as senior as an
              expert, yet still find yourself interesting and insightful things
              to learn through seemingly easier tasks. Thank you for inspiring

                Then, we kind of just started the process of writing blog posts
                about things we learned about css. And started merging each
                others' posts to our blog site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of this, I'd like to mention that some of our girls
                have very little programming background, and have joined the
                challenge just because they want to check out something cool.
                One of our consistent contributors did not know markdown nor git
                to begin with. And yet has many first-time checklist ticked
                throughout the challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think a lot of girl, self-taught, front end developers are
                quite amazing, if you consider what kind of (lack of systematic)
                training she has. By figuring a lot of things out by herself,
                there's a long way to go even before a first full time job.
                There are many, many such stories out there, in here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe next time you can hear some stories from such developers
                around you, and maybe next next time when you see her trying to
                make a contribution on her merge request, maybe you can spend
                more time to discuss and guide her to the right direction.

                There are many things that need fix also. My good will was to
                leave to participants to fix. But I was not doing a great job
                advocating that. So most of them are still unfixed.

              One day one participant asked me about a problem she encountered.
              Part of me was rushing out so I directed her to post the question
              in the channel, which she did. I turned to this thread after I got
              home and saw a couple of participants already found the bug in her
              code.

              And what's more, I saw one alternative implementation Huijing
              proposed that seemed really interesting. Since the original bug
              was actually not a CSS bug, rather, it was a JS bug. And we're
              doing CSS here. So I was thinking how I could redirect the thread

              Not long after I just started working as a front end developer, I
              worked on a design that contains a stamped edge. I didn’t know how
              to do it. So I did what I’ve been doing since college — I googled
              it.

                  position: absolute;
                  left: 5px; top: 5px; right: 5px; bottom: 5px;
                  z-index: -1;
                }

                I came across a number of solutions similar to [this one]. I
                thought I’d try to learn something out of it. After all, I’m a
                professional web developer now. I should not be the one just
                heartlessly copying and pasting snippets, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                So as I tried to understand the code, I thought the line
                content: '' (content semicolon empty string) was irrelevant.
                Maybe the author forgot to take it off. So I left out that line
                and, expectedly, my stamp edge did not show.

                I then went through a whole process of trying to find where that
                pseudo element went. I gave it a super big `width` and `height`,
                `background: red`, etc. I checked parent’s `position` because I
                recalled some relevancy there? But I simply could not find my
                pseudo element. I got so frustrated also because part of me did
                not put CSS as a top priority. My inner voice was like “Please,
                just let me get over with it so I can work on “more interesting”
                stuff”.
              </p>
              <p>
                My problem with this approach was that I did not understand
                where each line of code came from. And what can gravitate this
                issue with CSS is that more often than not *I thought I knew*.

              When their computed content value is not none, these

              A few years later I finally decided to read the CSS

                Well anyway, looking back, I gained a lot of my imperative
                knowledge that way. Running into the problems, stack overflow,
                until I get very bored of following others' solutions. A lot of
                senior developers have even told me that our field has too many
                scattered pieces of knowledge that I have to master in order to
                do my job properly. Maybe, just maybe, it is not because the
                knowledge is scattered around by themselves. But how we find
                solutions to our problem broke them into scattered pieces?

              <p>
                But CSS specifications is one set of well-edited, systematic
                documentations on how browsers should render the page according
                to the stylesheets. You can hardly find any other literature
                that actually helps you build consistent and complete knowledge
                about this aspect of browser behaviors. The more you read the
                CSS specs, the more connection you'll be able to make with one
                another.

                And furthermore, have you noticed that while some of us struggle
                to pass a so-called "plateau" and stop advancing from certain
                point of time, while some others seem to have kept advancing in
                their proficiency, and have you wondered why?
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I’d like to bring to your all's attention that we do not
                gain proficiency by following others’ solutions. We gain
                proficiency by solving the problems by ourselves. And best
                guidance is one that specifies the features of your tools and
                lets you come up with the solutions by yourself. And CSS
                specifications are exactly this kind of guidance.

                time-saving effort for you to master CSS. You'll gain
                cross-browser understanding about how CSS should be implemented
                from the vendors' and editors' perspective. And to share with
                you a secret, it brings this weird feeling of mastering CSS once
                you've read a few critical sections. And people will register
                you as someone who reads CSS specs, must be an expert.

                And as a girl developer, sense of respect comes in rarer form
                than our guy peers. If we are to master something, do it like we
                mean it.
