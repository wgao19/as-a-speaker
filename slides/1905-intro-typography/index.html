            <em>An Intro from a Historic Perspective</em>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Today, I'm talking about Typography. And in particular, I'd like
                to take on a historic perspective. Because a lot of the
                well-known fonts we use today are actually a revive of a
                typefaces from centuries ago. My eyes bright up when I read,
                say, certain font were the one used on the first printed version
                of US constitution. Would that be something that is interesting
                to you as well?
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, this talk serves as a precedence talk to Tiger's talk
                on fonts, which will happen next week. Please look forward to
                that.

                Gutenberg lived in the 15th century Germany, city of Mainz, near
                today's Frankfurt. His dad was a patrician merchant, patrician
                back then meaning he had certain societary recognition, was
                probably wealthy and political elite. It was believed that his
                dad was a goldsmith, one who makes gold articles, before he
                started trading.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the early life of Gutenberg himself was unknown, except
                the fact that he was probably familiar with the trade of
                goldsmithing.

              In the early 1400, Gutenberg's family moved to Strassberg likely
              due to political reasons. He was found in records to have gone to
              school, possibly married, enrolled as a goldsmith in the
              Strasbourg militia, as well as inheriting proceedings when his
              father passed away.

              It was also speculated that it was within the time he stayed in
              Strasbourg that he was formulating idea of movable type printing.

              I should pause here and mention that Bi Sheng of the Song dynasty
              of China was probably the earliest inventor of movable type
              printing. That dated back to around 1000. But in Europe it was
              still at the stage of an idea in the 15th century.

              It was believed that Gutenberg had perfected his research and
              experimentation on movable type printing around year of 1440. And
              by the time he moved back to Mainz in 1448, he took a loan from
              his brother-in-law, likely to start a printing shop.

                One major innovation of Gutenberg was apparently adapting the
                idea of his movable type printing method.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first part involved using a single, hand-carved character to
                create identical copies of itself. Each of those hand-carved
                character that will be used to create copies are called a
                "master piece" of a type.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cutting one single letter would take a craftsman a day of work,
                it was obviously impractical to be carving all the copies by
                hand. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron
                plate, called a matrix.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a matrix, a matrix for a font we'll be talking about
                later.
              </p>
              <p>
                A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a
                container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once
                cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The
                fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to
                produce many duplicates of the same letter.

                by the way, if you notice the metal strip beneath the actual
                letters, that transformed into what we current days refer to as
                "leading", a measurement in typography that describes the
                distance between two baselines of text.

                So you'd be arranging your letters into words, then blocks of
                texts, and eventually apply ink to the surface and press a paper
                against it, and make it to a final print.

                what's more, Gutenberg was known to have done text justification
                already, by using characters of narrower widths, adding extra
                spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces
                around words.

                Gutenberg was later on involved in a mortgage with a merchant,
                Johann Fust. At some point the cost of producing the 42-page
                bible proliferated, the mortgage went up, and Fust requested his
                money back, sued, and foreclosed. Gutenberg had to forfeit all

              After proven practical by Gutenberg's print shops, printing

                Here in this diagram, it marks the progression in colored dots
                by decades.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Gutenberg's decade, only Mainz and Strassburg had a
                meaningful number of print shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                A decade later, marked by the blue dots, major cities such as
                Paris and Venice joined the club, as well as serving as the
                "diffusion centers" for even more printing shops for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1481, barely 30 years after the publication of the 42-line
                Bible, even smallen nation such as Netherlands already featured
                printing shops in 21 cities and towns
              </p>
              <p>
                And there're probably a few things we can conclude from this
                phenomena, it must have been very lucrative. But I guess a more
                intereting one was probably that there evolved different styles
                and opinions of the art of printing. Likewise how we nowadays
                evolved many styles of coding.

                Here is one produced by a fifteen century Italian "punchcutter"
                named Francesco Griffo, one who literally punches in steel to
                make the letter types, was aiming to creating a more
                aesthetically even texture on the page.

              Francesco worked for a Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, who
              founded the Aldine Press, of which the first great achievement was
              a five-volumn folio edition of Aristotle.

                Francesco was then inspired by a writing manual by Giovanni
                Antonio Tagliente, and created his cutting.

                Bembo characterises an elegant tail on the Q that starts from
                the glyph's center, the uppercase J has a hook and the the

                And here is part of its specimen. In a specimen, you specify all
                the glyphs, in different sizes, which normally are measured in
                points, and 72 points make an inch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We got, upper case, upper case italic, lower case roman, lower

                letters with decorators, and ligatures
              </p>
              <p>
                If you notice there is a group where the letter forms look like
                capital letters, but smaller. Those are small caps, they are of
                same height of lowercase, and they are most often used to stress
                text without breaking flow of its surroundings.

              <p>
                Let me sneak in some more typographical terms here. Typographers
                refer to the height of lowercase letters by "x-height",
                understandably, that'll be the height of the letter lowercase x.
              </p>
              <p>So small caps are capital letters that match x-height.</p>
              <p>
                Then the imaginary line that sits on top of x will be the
                "median".
              </p>
              <p>
                And those strokes that extend beyond x-height are ascenders and
                descenders.
              </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                And furthermore, the terms "upper" and "lower" case do not
                actually mean bigger or smaller letters.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this another specimen of Bembo where we can observe more
                closely, the uppercase are letter forms of same height.
              </p>
              <p>And lowercase are ones with ascenders and descenders.</p>
              <p>
                They were originally called "majuscule" v.s. "miniscule", and
                the distinction applies to the numerals as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                So where did the term uppercase and lowercase come from? Turns
                out,

                Turns out, they refer to the cases that were used to hold those
                metal types.
              </p>
              <p>
                They were called the "job cases". Originally one large case was
                used for each typeface, then "divided cases", pairs of cases for
                majuscules and minuscules, were introduced sixteenth centry. And
                the term upper and lower case came from this division.

                A punchcutter now known as Claude Garamond, while apparently
                influenced by the Venetian style, remember Francesco was
                Venetian, Garamond was trying to create letters with a
                relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen.
              </p>
              <p>
                The types he created are more expressive, looked more like a
                caligrapher's pen, compared with Venetian style that looked more
                stiff, as you may see here most spectacularly via the r.
              </p>
              <p>
                Garamond features a small eye in the lowercase `e` that is
                perhaps the most distinctive feature of the font.

                At the turn of the 18th century, Philippe Grandjean (French) was

                I did not find a specimen for the original Baskervile, but here
                is a revival of Baskerville by Isaac Moore's type following
                Baskerville's style, and I think one of the most recognizable
                feature is the italic `a` where the stroke of the counter

              Baskerville's innovations exerted a notable influence on European

                Bodoni was an Italian typographer in late eighteenth century
                Italy. He was born in a printer family, both his father and his
                grandfather were printers. And as a child his toys were his
                grandfather's leftover punches and matrices. He grew up having
                an ambition of becoming a printer.

                Bodoni traveled to Rome where he started as an assistant
                compositor, a.k.a. typesetter, one who sets the types to make
                prints. From my understanding this role requires a taste in
                aesthetics similar to one who does typography design of a
                webpage now. And Bodoni was apparently talented, he soon became
                the press's compositor of foreign languages, and started to
                typeset books.

                His fellows were so delighted with his work on the "Pontificale
                Arabo-Copto" that they allowed him to add his name and
                birthplace to subsequent printings. He then began cutting his
                own punches.

                That is a separate story, but Firmin Didot also designed his own

                and Bodoni's together are known as "Didone", which is an

                The industrial revolution of the 19th century changed printing,
                typesetting, and type-casting from the product of the human hand
                to the product of power-driven machinery. Thousands of copies
                could be printed in the time it formerly took to print dozens.

              <p>
                It also created a market of consumers for manufacturers. The
                requirement to advertise products to mass consumers drove
                printers began to distinguish between book printing and
                commercial printing.

              A type alone will not complete a typography design because we need
              to take into consideration how letters form words, words to
              sentences, sentences to paragraphs, to page.

            <p>
              I am very grateful to have Ken and Tiger who helped me with the
              rehearse of this talk. Thank you two for pushing me to refine the
              content on history. It feels like looking closer with a higher
              resolution and I believe that's how we shall learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a pity that I did not have time to go into a broader sense
              of typography, and had to leave out the part that talks about how
              letters form words, how words form sentences, and how sentences
              form paragraphs, and paragraphs pages
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope I have triggered some curious minds, who will carry on
              sharing with us about this topics.
