              I am a React developer, and I am kind of a fan of Dan Abramov's.
              December of last year, he created a new blog site called
              overreacted.io üò≤ He uses this lovely pinkish theme and has those
              cute coffee indicators for how long it might take to read.

                Gatsby believes one such way is developer experience. It allows
                you to pick a starter and get to your content quickly. I think
                it actually encourages you to start with a starter. Here is the
                starter library that contains official and community starters.

              While the behavior of picking a starter feels much like picking a

              offers a flexible range of customizability.

              For example, I was particularly interested in this community site
              starter when I was creating the site for our React Knowledgeable.
              It has implemented a few utility fields in the frontmatter of each
              post (markdown files) and it organizes the pages according to
              community events. It also checks and computes days to display
              information such as the event is upcoming or has already passed.

                I‚Äôd like to mention again that for all those feature, you‚Äôre
                gonna write React and GraphQL. This goes beyond the scope of
                customizability of a themed blog because once you‚Äôre done
                running the starter script, the code is completely handed over

              <p>
                This is perhaps one reason why us React engineers might both
                gain the most satisfaction and be most expressive with building

              There is one that I think can be particularly interesting to us.
              The gatsby-advanced-starter which is nearly barebone in terms of
              features, it specifically does not join the fight for styling, and
              it leaves nearly all customizability to us. But it does nicely
              come with some essentials such as SEO, Google Analytics, tags and
              categories, twitter, etc.

                There are similarities and differences between book printing and
                web typography. But their motivations are rather aligned, and
                beside the apparent styling purpose we may think of, I‚Äôd like to
                quote this:
              </p>
              <p>
                So typography is this set of rules of font families, font sizes,
                indents, line spacings, progression of headers, etc etc, that
                defines how your website displays its content, mainly texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, this serves as our mini intro to typography which I‚Äôd like
                to have a separate talk if folks are interested, today I‚Äôll show
                you how it works in the blog starter.

              Kyle also developed a library called Typography that allows you to
              choose from a repertoire of themes that you may use directly. You
              may see those themes in this demo website.

                You may as well define your own typography. How it works is that
                you define some basics to your site‚Äôs typography. It will help
                you sort out (or lets you customize) the font sizing, line
                spacing, etc, using a mechanism called vertical rhythm.
              </p>
              <p>
                This once again aligns with how Gatsby provides us with both the
                readiness and customizability of how we want to implement our
                sites.

              With traditional website or blog site, you save everything in a
              database. Pages are generated by a server, and the server requests
              the data dynamically according to what the user requests.

                With static site generators, everything is static and they get
                compiled into html pages at build time, and in case of Gatsby,
                they‚Äôre React components.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would like to mention that in real life Gatsby sites compile
                contents not just from markdown files. There may be a mesh of
                content coming in from different sources including CMS and
                Gatsby handles them all.

            <p>
              Are the changes from content or behavior?
            </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              I guess one way to think about whether the dynamic part of your
              content comes from the changes of the content itself, or behavior
              of your users. Inventory stock is definitely dynamic with respect
              to user behavior, so it is with ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and comments.

                Then what about blog posts, event or product descriptions. They
                won‚Äôt change unless you create something new. So when this is
                the case, maybe you don‚Äôt need a dynamic server after all. Is
                database necessarily better than a file to save your post?
              </p>
              <p>
                I thought these are some questions that JAMStack urges us to
                think about.

              Now, what if your product is a service or climbing gym multi
              passes that will never go out of stock as long as your are not out
              of business? Then all you need is a payment service fed in by an
              API and connected to your components, likely with hooks.

            Do you have a ‚Äùdynamic‚Äù team of content generators?
            <aside class="notes">
              If that‚Äôs the case, you probably need a CMS to manage content
              generation. Treating this as a separate process, we can feed our
              Gatsby sites with content from CMS. And if you look at the
              starters library you can see many starters are already powered by
              CMS.

            Building <i>web</i> again?

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                I have an affection with static websites because that was how
                websites were born with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not many of us were from the web pages where HTML + CSS built
                the foundation of your website. Back then when you add new
                content to your website, you may need to write new HTML and CSS,
                to craft the webpage specifically for the new content. The code
                was naturally split by pages and directories, everything was
                server side rendered. Sometimes build dynamic servers for
                content but in general, the web technologies were quite
                straightforward.

              Not all businesses act like or live in e-commerce platforms like
              Amazon, and not all the content we browse on the internet requires
              as complex features as to be called an application. There are
              solutions in all kinds of format and JAMStack just happens to be
              one of them that work, one that embraces edging technology in its
              own way and is accessible to more businesses.

              ReactJS Meetup Mar 2019
            </small>
            <aside class="notes">
              React 16.8 was released just earlier last month. And in the
              ReactJS meetup I went to in March, one developer from Stripe
              presented to us how to use hooks to connect to their API in a
              Gatsby site. And I believe hooks are already in production in may
              of those business products already. The work we do as end
              developers is no longer complex, it gets us direct access to
              content, and therefore impact, if we shall create.

                This is from a local food critique. If I'm not wrong, he used to
                own or chef a cafe as well. Regardless, he posts reviews and his
                own or his wife's cooking on a daily basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                I personally follow him on Instagram, and I've learned many of
                the local places to eat from there.

              <p>
                So this is like you have a living around React, while also keep
                telling people what you think is good about it.
